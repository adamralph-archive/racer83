# Racer '83

Lifted from my talk "Tales from an OSS Contributor".

Back in '83 my Dad bought me my first computer, the humble [Acorn Electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_Electron), little brother of the fabled [BBC Micro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro).

The Electron and BBC were blessed with one of the best 8 bit BASICs to have existed and I soon lost myself in hacking on computer game listings from books and magazines.

This game was the one I remember being able to type from scratch in about a minute flat, something that came in fairly useful for making friends at school, since we were banned from running commercial games on our school's BBC Micro. Embarassingly, it took me hours to recreate this as the language had completely faded from my memory.

### To run the game

* Run a BBC emulator, e.g. the excellent [BeebEm](http://www.mkw.me.uk/beebem/).
* Get the contents of RACER83.bas into your emulator using the best method available. E.g. in BeebEm you can just copy the text and then hit 'Paste' from the 'Edit' menu.
* Type `RUN` and press enter
* VVRRRROOOMMM!!!!
